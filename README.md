# Scientific-Computing-With-Python 

This is a repository with all my knowledge gained from the [Scientific Computing With Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) certification from FreeCodeCamp.

All comments and details in this repository are available in Spanish.

In this repository, as well as in the certification, you will find information about the basics of Python and its structures, libraries for reading HTML, text files, and JSON/XML, information about the basics of SQL, and much more. You will also find the projects required to obtain the certification, created with the knowledge acquired in this course.
